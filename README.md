# :man_technologist: Sagar Kapoor's Blog

[This website](https://www.sagarkapoor.eu/) has been generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) & [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod). This current repository holds all the assets of the website which can be promptly used as a starting template for your first static site. Hugo which is a Static Site Generator(SSG) built with [Golang](https://golang.org/) generates the static contents for the site to be deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

 ## :checkered_flag: Getting Started 

 I will just put it out there. If you want to make a website, there are many ways to do so. You can always make it through [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) and many such other **Content Management Systems** **(CMS)**  out there. But if you have read this far then I take it that you are aware of [JamStack](https://jamstack.org/). 

**Steps**

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your copy of the repository locally using the command `git clone git@github.com:<INSERT_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE>/SagarKapoor.EU.git`.
3. Remove the files under the directory `content`.
4. Ensure you've Hugo installed & is available on PATH. If not, then follow the instructions available in [the official documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
5. `cd` into the folder where you cloned the Git repository. Then run `hugo server` to see if the site runs locally. 

## :gear: Making this site yours!

When you run the `hugo server` command successfully a link will be provided on your terminal which will lead you to a local build of your site on your browser. If not you can always access it through this address `http://localhost:1313/` **after** running the `hugo server` command. 

You will notice that the website still has many remnants from my site. Let's get that all hacked out :fast_forward: :

1. All the content pages need to be in the [.md](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) file format.
2. You will be writing all of your blog posts under the `/content/posts/` directory. All other pages such as About and Archives will go under `/content` directory. 
3.
